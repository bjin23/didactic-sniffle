# X-Team 60 Rules

These rules establish how our team will assign tasks,
track progress on each task, and communicate with each other 
when a member is unable to complete a task that has been assigned to that member.

This document helps individual members understand the team's expectations,
and will hopefully lead to productive team work with fewer conflicts
and missed deadlines.

## How we will assign (and reassign) tasks
* The group leader will be the primary delegator of tasks, ultimately responsible for who does what
  * It should be that whatever tasks that the group leader assigns is with the active consent of the person being assigned said task

* After a reasonable amount of time (say, 1 week if the assignment is due in 2-3 weeks), the group will reconvene and everybody will report their progress on their delegated task. If some group member is struggling with a certain task, the group will discuss the difficulties of the task and either give the group member some advice about to approach the task, or some other group member will inherit the task.
