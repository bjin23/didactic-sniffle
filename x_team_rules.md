# X-Team 60 Rules

These rules establish how our team will assign tasks,
track progress on each task, and communicate with each other 
when a member is unable to complete a task that has been assigned to that member.

This document helps individual members understand the team's expectations,
and will hopefully lead to productive team work with fewer conflicts
and missed deadlines.

## How we will assign (and reassign) tasks
* The group leader will be the primary delegator of tasks, ultimately responsible for who does what
  * It should be that whatever tasks that the group leader assigns is with the active consent of the person being assigned said task

* After a reasonable amount of time (say, 1 week if the assignment is due in 2-3 weeks), the group will reconvene in person and everybody will report their progress on their delegated task. If some group member is struggling with a certain task, the group will discuss the difficulties of the task and either give the group member some advice about how to approach the task, or some other group member will be assigned the task. 
## How will we will track progress (and follow-up) on completion of tasks
* Each individual will be in communication with the general group (through a group chat or email) about his/her progress every few days
  * It is the responsibility of each individual to make sure at minimum the group leader is aware of the level of progress of the individual's tasks
* The group leader will be expected to follow-up on individuals who do not follow the above guidelines
* As stated above, a physical meeting will also occur if necessary. 

## How we will communicate difficulties with a task assigned to us
* Small issues should be quickly communicated and resolved through email or group chat. More substantial difficulties that cannot be resolved online will be dealt with during the physical meeting, where group members can brainstorm solutions and possibly reassign tasks. 


## How we will back up each other to ensure that deadlines are not missed
* Constant and frequent accountability updates to the general group and to the group leader specifically. Given that this is a small group, it would make sense that the group notify each member of the others' progress, so that everyone is on the same page as to what the group is behind on.
  * This also means that there is more than one person (group leader) keeping other members in check at all times.
